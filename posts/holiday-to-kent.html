				Hey, welcome back to my blog, in this blog, I'll be talking about my holiday to Kent I recently had.
				<br>
				If you're wondering what area of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent" style="color: #add8e6">Kent</a> I went to, I went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitstable" style="color: #add8e6">Whitsable</a>.
				<br>
				<br>
				<h3 class="subtitle is-4">The Area</h3>
				Overall, the area of Whitsable is rather dull to be honest. In addition to this, there's not a huge amount of to do there, apart from maybe have a trip onto the Whitsable Beach.
				<br>
				However, there were a great array of restraurants and other places to eat throughout the high streets that I saw while I was there.
				<br>
				<br>
				<h4 class="subtitle is-4">Where I stayed</h4>
				I stayed in a, in short, really big house. It had 2 floors and 4 bedrooms, just keep in mind I was staying here with 3 other people, so the we got a room each, which is always nice.
				<br>
				Moreover, it also had a massive TV, along a immense kitchen with a huge array of utilities stored in that kitchen, all at our disposal.
				<br>
				<br>
				<h5 class="subtitle is-4">Internet</h5>
				It wouldn't be a blog about Kent without talking about the, questionable to say the least, internet connection.
				<br>
				If you want a rough idea of what speeds I got, feel free to check <a href="http://www.speedtest.net/result/7192837410" style="color: #add8e6">here</a>.
				<br>
				Compared to my last experience with internet in Kent a couple of months ago (I had to suffer dial-up for about 5 days), this is a lot better.
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>
				<h6 class="subtitle is-4">Conclusion</h6>
				In conclusion, I think Kent is a nice place, but it just needs more to do. <del>and needs better internet speeds</del>
				<br>
				However, the houses and the people <i>seem</i> nice, and there's a good variety of restraurants and shops.
				<br>
				<br>
				Apart from that, thanks for reading!
